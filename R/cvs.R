#' Vector of rsids for causal variants of two simulated traits
#'
#' This is the vector c(c1,c2,c3) = c("rs61839660","rs62626317","rs11594656") for the provided simulation example of two traits 
#' where one trait has causal variants c1+c2 and the other trait has causal variants c1+c3; the traits have shared causal variant
#' c1.
